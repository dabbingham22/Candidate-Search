# Candidate-Search

## Description
This is a react application that allows search candidates, save them and view potential candidates that you saved in the job market. This is using an API that was already set up on the backend. Updates were made to the front end pages to display the nav bar, candidate search page, savedcandidates page. All of this was done using the typescript. The app is running the API through a GitHub Personall Access Token that is saved to the environment file.
